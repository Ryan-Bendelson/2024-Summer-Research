This is the code I worked on for my 2024 Summer Research project. The main feature I worked on is a function that takes in a Kronecker product density matrix and a specified qubit to return the partial trace of the density matrix over the specified qubit.
This function is based on a visual method I came up with that helped me to identify how to take the partial trace of a density matrix representing a composite quantum system. It works based on splitting the full sized matrix into smaller submatrices that can be evaluated individually. The results of evaluating each submatrix are placed into appropriate spots in a larger result matrix for the full partial trace.
